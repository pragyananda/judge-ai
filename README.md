## Introduction

**Judge AI (JAi)** is an **open-source project** dedicated to enhancing legal information retrieval. It achieves this by integrating **structured data extraction** with **conversational access** to legal documents . This system harnesses the power of **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Large Language Models (LLMs)** to efficiently process legal case files. JAi aims to alleviate the challenges faced by legal professionals in navigating vast collections of unstructured legal documents . By providing a more efficient and accessible way to retrieve relevant legal information, JAi has the potential to optimise legal operations .

## Key Features

*   **Structured Data Extraction:** JAi employs **NLP and LLMs** to extract crucial information from legal case files, such as title types, case numbers, petitioner and respondent details, legal sections, and judgment summaries . This extracted data is organised into a consistent **JSON format**, facilitating accurate and efficient data retrieval .
*   **Conversational Access:** The system offers an **intuitive chat interface** that enables users to easily upload, search, and interact with individual case files .
*   **Smart Conversational Agent:** JAi features a **vector-based conversational agent** capable of understanding user queries and retrieving pertinent legal information from one or multiple uploaded case files . This allows for quick access to accurate legal answers and the ability to perform **cross-case comparisons** within a single interaction .
*   **Enhanced Legal Research:** By providing structured data and conversational capabilities, JAi significantly reduces the manual effort traditionally associated with legal research . It aims to assist legal professionals in promptly identifying relevant precedents and interconnecting legal knowledge .
*   **Open-Source:** This project is **openly available on GitHub**, encouraging community involvement and contributions to its ongoing development .

## Benefits

*   **Improved Efficiency:** Automates the time-consuming process of manually extracting information from large volumes of unstructured legal documents .
*   **Enhanced Accuracy:** Structured data extraction ensures consistent and precise retrieval of key legal information [1, 4].
*   **Streamlined Legal Research:** The conversational interface and multi-document search capabilities simplify and accelerate the process of finding relevant legal information .
*   **Increased Accessibility:** Makes complex legal information more accessible through an easy-to-use chat-based interaction .

## Getting Started

To get started with Judge AI, please refer to the **project repository on GitHub** for detailed setup instructions and dependencies.

## Usage
